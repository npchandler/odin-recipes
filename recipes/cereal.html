    <h2>Cereal and More</h2>
        <p>The pinnacle of the breakfast routine: Cereal remains indisputably the most scrumptious and tasty morningtime meal one could hope to consume. Though long and arduous, humanity's path
            through history toward the coveted O's remains a testament to the willpower of all those who came before today's time. And now, through divine grace, humans sit at the precipice of a
            renaissance rooted in cereal-based products. It is our duty now, as the descendants of the great leaders and thinkers that paved the way, to not only flourish in the fruits of their
            labor, but to pick up where they left off. The pursuit for the perfect bowl of cereal will not fade into the night, as the final flickers of a lonely candle would vanish into obscurity.
            The pursuit for the perfect bowl of cereal will rage on endlessly; an eternal, roaring flame shining light on all those who believe in its truth.
